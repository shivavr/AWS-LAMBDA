This project showcases an innovative approach to event-driven data workflows by leveraging AWS Lambda and Prefect. It demonstrates:
Key Features
Seamless deployment of multiple Prefect flows as serverless Lambda functions
Flexible execution triggers:
Time-based scheduling
S3 object creation events
Streamlined configuration using YAML and the Serverless Framework
Technical Highlights
Event-Driven Architecture: Utilize S3 events to initiate data processing workflows automatically
Serverless Scalability: Harness AWS Lambda's auto-scaling capabilities for cost-effective data operations
Workflow Orchestration: Leverage Prefect's powerful flow management and monitoring capabilities
Infrastructure as Code: Define and version your entire serverless setup using YAML configurations
Benefits
Reduced operational overhead with serverless architecture
Improved responsiveness to data events
Enhanced workflow visibility and management through Prefect
Simplified deployment and configuration process
